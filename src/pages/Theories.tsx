                  These theories represent humanity's best attempts to understand the fundamental nature of reality. While some are well-established with substantial evidence, others remain speculative, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Scientists continue to test these theories through observations, experiments, and mathematical analysis. Each discovery brings us closer to answering the deepest questions about existence: How did the universe begin? What is it made of? What is its ultimate fate?
